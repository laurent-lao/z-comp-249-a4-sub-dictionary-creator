IS
THE

ASSERTED
THAT

BE
TURNED
INTO
ENERGY
NOT
SINCE
ISAAC
NEWTON
HAD
ONE
MAN
SO
DRASTICALLY
ALTERED
OUR
UNDERSTANDING
OF
HOW
THE
UNIVERSE
WORKS
YET
WHILE
EINSTEIN
CLEARLY
HAD
A
KNACK
FOR
SCIENCE
AND
MATHEMATICS
FROM
AN
EARLY
AGE
HE
DID
NOT
EXCEL
AT
EVERYTHING
HE
PUT
HIS
MIND

AND
STIFLED
BY
THE
SCHOOL
RIGID
PEDAGOGICAL
APPROACH

WAS
AN
AVERAGE
PUPIL
AND
EXPERIENCED
SPEECH
CHALLENGES
WHICH
PERMANENTLY
INFLUENCED
HIS
VIEW
OF
EDUCATION
AND
HUMAN
POTENTIAL

WAS
LARGELY
IN
HIS
PRIVATE
TIME
IN
FACT
THAT
EINSTEIN

AND
INQUISITIVENESS
FOR
SCIENCE
AND
MATHEMATICS
FIRST
FLOURISHED
AND
AFTER
FINISHING
HIS
STUDIES
IN
ZURICH
IN

IT
WAS
AGAIN
IN
HIS
LEISURE
TIME
WHILE
WORKING
AT
THE
SWISS

AS
A
YOUNG
ADULT
THAT
HE
DEVELOPED
MANY
OF
HIS
MOST
INFLUENTIAL
THEORIES

IN
null
AND
WORKED
AT
PRINCETON
UNIVERSITY
IN
NEW
JERSEY
FOR
THE
REST
OF
HIS
DAYS
THERE
HE
BECAME
A
CENTRAL
FIGURE
IN
THE
FIGHT
TO
CURTAIL
THE
USE
OF
THE
ATOM
BOMB
AND
A
STRONG
VOICE
AGAINST
RACISM
AND

NAME
HAS
BECOME
SYNONYMOUS
WITH
GENIUS
AND
CREATIVITY
NAMED
PERSON
OF
THE
CENTURY
BY
TIME
IN
null
EINSTEIN
IS
A
RARE
ICON
WHOSE
WISDOM
EXTENDED
FAR
BEYOND
THE
REALM
OF
SCIENCE
TO
REVEAL
A
MAN
WITH
AN
ALMOST
CHILDLIKE
SENSE
OF
WONDER
AND
A
PROFOUND
LOVE
OF
HUMANITY
SOME
OF
THE
MOST
INSPIRING
ALBERT
EINSTEIN
QUOTES
ARE
FEW
ARE
THOSE
WHO
SEE
WITH
THEIR
OWN
EYES
AND
FEEL
WITH
THEIR
OWN
HEARTS
IMAGINATION
IS
MORE
IMPORTANT
THAN
KNOWLEDGE
KNOWLEDGE
IS
LIMITED
IMAGINATION
ENCIRCLES
THE
WORLD
UNTHINKING
RESPECT
FOR
AUTHORITY
IS
THE
GREATEST
ENEMY
OF
TRUTH
TRY
NOT
TO
BECOME
A
MAN
OF
SUCCESS
BUT
RATHER
TRY
TO
BECOME
A
MAN
OF
VALUE
I
AM
BY
HERITAGE
A
JEW
BY
CITIZENSHIP
A
SWISS
AND
BY
MAKEUP
A
HUMAN
BEING
AND
ONLY
A
HUMAN
BEING
WITHOUT
ANY
SPECIAL
ATTACHMENT
TO
ANY
STATE
OR
NATIONAL
ENTITY
WHATSOEVER
GREAT
SPIRITS
HAVE
ALWAYS
ENCOUNTERED
VIOLENT
OPPOSITION
FROM
MEDIOCRE
MINDS
NOT
EVERYTHING
THAT
CAN
BE
COUNTED
COUNTS
AND
NOT
EVERYTHING
THAT
COUNTS
CAN
BE
COUNTED
EVERYBODY
IS
A
GENIUS
BUT
IF
YOU
JUDGE
A
FISH
BY
ITS
ABILITY
TO
CLIMB
A
TREE
IT
WILL
LIVE
ITS
WHOLE
LIFE
BELIEVING
THAT
IT
IS
STUPID
LOOK
DEEP
INTO
NATURE
AND
THEN
YOU
WILL
UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING
BETTER
ALL
RELIGIONS
ARTS
AND
SCIENCES
ARE
BRANCHES
OF
THE
SAME
TREE
ANY
INTELLIGENT
FOOL
CAN
MAKE
THINGS
BIGGER
AND
MORE
COMPLEX
IT
TAKES
A
TOUCH
OF
GENIUS
AND
A
LOT
OF
COURAGE
TO
MOVE
IN
THE
OPPOSITE
DIRECTION
A
MAN
SHOULD
LOOK
FOR
WHAT
IS
AND
NOT
FOR
WHAT
HE
THINKS
SHOULD
BE
IN
THE
MIDDLE
OF
DIFFICULTY
LIES
OPPORTUNITY
A
PERSON
WHO
NEVER
MADE
A
MISTAKE
NEVER
TRIED
ANYTHING
NEW
EDUCATION
IS
WHAT
REMAINS
AFTER
ONE
HAS
FORGOTTEN
WHAT
ONE
HAS
LEARNED
IN
SCHOOL
A
TABLE
A
CHAIR
A
BOWL
OF
FRUIT
AND
A
VIOLIN
WHAT
ELSE
DOES
A
MAN
NEED
TO
BE
HAPPY
A
HUMAN
BEING
IS
PART
OF
A
WHOLE
CALLED
BY
US
THE
UNIVERSE
THE
IMPORTANT
THING
IS
TO
NOT
STOP
QUESTIONING
CURIOSITY
HAS
ITS
OWN
REASON
FOR
EXISTING
A
QUESTION
THAT
SOMETIMES
DRIVES
ME
HAZY
AM
I
OR
ARE
THE
OTHERS
CRAZY
ANGER
DWELLS
ONLY
IN
THE
BOSOM
OF
FOOLS
LIFE
IS
LIKE
RIDING
A
BICYCLE
TO
KEEP
YOUR
BALANCE
YOU
MUST
KEEP
MOVING
CONCERN
FOR
MAN
AND
HIS
FATE
MUST
ALWAYS
FORM
THE
CHIEF
INTEREST
OF
ALL
TECHNICAL
ENDEAVORS
NEVER
FORGET
THIS
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
YOUR
DIAGRAMS
AND
EQUATIONS
THERE
ARE
ONLY
TWO
WAYS
TO
LIVE
YOUR
LIFE
ONE
IS
AS
THOUGH
NOTHING
IS
A
MIRACLE
THE
OTHER
IS
AS
THOUGH
EVERYTHING
IS
A
MIRACLE
ALL
THAT
IS
VALUABLE
IN
HUMAN
SOCIETY
DEPENDS
UPON
THE
OPPORTUNITY
FOR
DEVELOPMENT
ACCORDED
THE
INDIVIDUAL
ONCE
YOU
STOP
LEARNING
YOU
START
DYING
IT
NOT
THAT
I
SO
SMART
IT
JUST
THAT
I
STAY
WITH
PROBLEMS
LONGER
IT
HAS
BECOME
APPALLINGLY
OBVIOUS
THAT
OUR
TECHNOLOGY
HAS
EXCEEDED
OUR
HUMANITY
ONLY
ONE
WHO
DEVOTES
HIMSELF
TO
A
CAUSE
WITH
HIS
WHOLE
STRENGTH
AND
SOUL
CAN
BE
A
TRUE
MASTER
FOR
THIS
REASON
MASTERY
DEMANDS
ALL
OF
A
PERSON
HE
WHO
CAN
NO
LONGER
PAUSE
TO
WONDER
AND
STAND
RAPT
IN
AWE
IS
AS
GOOD
AS
DEAD
HIS
EYES
ARE
CLOSED
I
HAVE
NO
SPECIAL
TALENT
I
AM
ONLY
PASSIONATELY
CURIOUS
WEAK
PEOPLE
REVENGE
STRONG
PEOPLE
FORGIVE
INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE
IGNORE
A
SHIP
IS
ALWAYS
SAFE
AT
SHORE
BUT
THAT
IS
NOT
WHAT
IT
BUILT
FOR
WHAT
IS
RIGHT
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
POPULAR
AND
WHAT
IS
POPULAR
IS
NOT
ALWAYS
RIGHT
EDUCATION
IS
NOT
THE
LEARNING
OF
FACTS
IT
RATHER
THE
TRAINING
OF
THE
MIND
TO
THINK
I
SPEAK
TO
EVERYONE
IN
THE
SAME
WAY
WHETHER
HE
IS
THE
GARBAGE
MAN
OR
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
UNIVERSITY
I
AM
THANKFUL
FOR
ALL
OF
THOSE
WHO
SAID
NO
TO
ME
ITS
BECAUSE
OF
THEM
I
DOING
IT
MYSELF
NEVER
GIVE
UP
ON
WHAT
YOU
REALLY
WANT
TO
DO
THE
PERSON
WITH
BIG
DREAMS
IS
MORE
POWERFUL
THAN
THE
ONE
WITH
ALL
THE
FACTS
COMMON
SENSE
IS
THE
COLLECTION
OF
PREJUDICES
ACQUIRED
BY
AGE
EIGHTEEN
